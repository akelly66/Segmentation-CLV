## Mission

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of clustering algorithms in order to segment customers that purchased from the Google Merchandise Store, as well as assess the lifetime value of those customers using the <a href="https://lifetimes.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html">Lifetimes</a> package, developed by the former lead data scientist at Shopify. Segmentation is necessary to understand the purchase patterns of customers and craft messages that will resonate and lead to future purchases. Assessing customer lifetime value will help to develop budgets and cost per conversion amounts.
